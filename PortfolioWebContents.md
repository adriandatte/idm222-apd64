INTRO: Since I was 7 years old, I have been creating movies using myself,
objects, and friends and family as characters. Before that age, I would create
my own miniature film sets using household furniture and spaces in my house
where I would act out scenes from movies. 

        Later on, I began making my own videos and movies using a small picture
camera. I would start and stop recording as a form of editing since I didn’t
have a computer to trim and edit. 

        By age 10, I began to use a desktop Mac to edit my videos. I taught
myself most of the editing process in Final Cut Express. Later on I found
professionals who helped me learn a few specifics about the software. 

        Ever since then, I have been directing, acting, filming, editing and
compositing my videos and movies. Most of them range about 15-25 minutes. I have
made several one-hour+ feature length films.

        The most recent feature film is on my YouTube channel and can also be
found on this website.

        I enjoy working with editing in special fx such as: compositing, green
screen keying, masking, cloning, match-moving, 3D camera tracking and
compositing, color corrections, basic editing, sound syncing.

        I also enjoy coming up with detailed stories/plots on the fly. That is
how I usually make my shorter 15 minute videos. I use my imagination on a
regular basis and that is usually how I generate great ideas for my videos.
